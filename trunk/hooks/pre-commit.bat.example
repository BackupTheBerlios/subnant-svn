REM PRE-COMMIT HOOK
REM 
REM  The pre-commit hook is invoked before a Subversion txn is
REM  committed.  Subversion runs this hook by invoking a program
REM  (script, executable, binary, etc.) named 'pre-commit' (for which
REM  this file is a template), with the following ordered arguments:
REM 
REM    [1] REPOS-PATH   (the path to this repository)
REM    [2] TXN-NAME     (the name of the txn about to be committed)
REM 
REM  The default working directory for the invocation is undefined, so
REM  the program should set one explicitly if it cares.
REM 
REM  If the hook program exits with success, the txn is committed; but
REM  if it exits with failure (non-zero), the txn is aborted, no commit
REM  takes place, and STDERR is returned to the client.   The hook
REM  program can use the 'svnlook' utility to help it examine the txn.
REM 
REM  On a Unix system, the normal procedure is to have 'pre-commit'
REM  invoke other programs to do the real work, though it may do the
REM  work itself too.
REM 
REM    ***  NOTE: THE HOOK PROGRAM MUST NOT MODIFY THE TXN, EXCEPT  ***
REM    ***  FOR REVISION PROPERTIES (like svn:log or svn:author).   ***
REM 
REM    This is why we recommend using the read-only 'svnlook' utility.
REM    In the future, Subversion may enforce the rule that pre-commit
REM    hooks should not modify the versioned data in txns, or else come
REM    up with a mechanism to make it safe to do so (by informing the
REM    committing client of the changes).  However, right now neither
REM    mechanism is implemented, so hook writers just have to be careful.
REM 
REM  Note that 'pre-commit' must be executable by the user(s) who will
REM  invoke it (typically the user httpd runs as), and that user must
REM  have filesystem-level permission to access the repository.
