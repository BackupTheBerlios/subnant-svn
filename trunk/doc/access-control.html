    <h3>Using Subversion properties for repository access control</h3>

    <p>Using <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch07s02.html">properties</a>
        in partnership with 
        <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch05s02.html#svn-ch-5-sect-2.1">pre-processing hooks</a>
        and <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch05s03.html#svn-ch-5-sect-3.1.1">svnlook</a>,
        we can provide a flexible, granular, visible and version controlled mechanism for
        access control independent of the repository access method.</p>

    <p>Two properties are required.  One to control who can give commit rights, and one to control
        who can commit.  These properties can exist on individual files or directories, or on the
        parent directories of files or directories governed by acesss control.  They do not have
        to exist in tandem in the same location, however both should exist in the repository at
        the top level of the path you wish to control.</p>

    <p>Caveat: This approach does not provide user authentication. The repository access method
        will still need to provide authentication to the server.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>property: </dfn><span class="term">hook:commit-access</span></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>This property contains a line delimited list of users who are permitted to commit
                the file or directory of the property in question.  For directories, this permission
                cascades down to sub-directories and files within these sub-directories.</p>

            <p>Conversely, this property can also explicitly deny access if any user is prefixed
                with an exclamation mark !.  This can be useful when a user has been given access
                rights higher up the repository path.</p>

            <p>e.g. To give user <var>admin1</var> and <var>user1</var> commit rights to any part
                of the repository, <em>hook:commit-access</em> is set to the following values on
                the repository root:</p>

            <p><samp>admin1<br />
                user1</samp></p>
        </dd>

        <dt><dfn>property: </dfn><span class="term">hook:propchange-access</span></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>This property contains a line delimited list of properties.  Each property is
                suffixed with an equals sign followed by a comma delimited list of users 
                permitted to modify the property.</p>

            <p>Conversely, this property can also explicitly deny access if any user is prefixed
                with an exclamation mark !.  This can be useful when a user has been given access
                rights higher up the repository path.</p>

            <p>To enable changes to access control, this property needs to set values for two
                properties, the first controls who is allowed to modify the
                <em>hook:propchange-access</em> property, the second controls who is allowed
                to modify the <em>hook:commit-access</em> property.</p>

            <p>Excluding the <em>hook:propchange-access</em> and <em>hook:commit-access</em>
                properties, it is possible to add wildcard matches for properties using an
                asterix *.</p>

            <p>e.g. To give user <var>admin1</var> rights to control who is allowed to modify the 
                <em>hook:propchange-access</em> property, and users <var>admin1</var> and 
                <var>user1</var> rights to modify the <em>hook:commit-access</em> property,
                and to give <var>user1</var> rights to modify any property, and apply all of
                these rights to any part of the repository, the <em>hook:propchange-access</em>
                property is set to the following values on the repository root:</p>

            <p><samp>hook:propchange-access=admin1<br />
                hook:commit-access=admin1,user1<br />
                *=user1</samp></p>

            <p>If <var>admin1</var> wanted to prevent <var>user1</var> from modifying who can
                commit to a particular path in the repository, say in the <samp>/admin-only</samp>
                directory, then <var>admin1</var> would set the following value to the
                <em>hook:propchange-access</em> property on the <var>/admin-only</var>
                directory:</p>

            <p><samp>hook:commit-access=!user1</samp></p>

            <p>If <var>admin1</var> also wanted to prevent <var>user1</var> from committing in
                <samp>/admin-only</samp>, then <var>admin1</var> would set the following value to
                the <em>hook:commit-access</em> property on the <samp>/admin-only</samp>
                directory:</p>

            <p><samp>!user1</samp></p>
        </dd>

        <dt><dfn>hook: </dfn><span class="term">pre-commit</span></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>This hook script searches HEAD revision for <em>hook:commit-access</em>
                properties on the files and directories being changed.  If the property is not
                found, each parent directory back to the repository root is searched. If a
                matching property is found, the user's permission is verified and the search
                is stopped.  If no match is found, permission is denied.</p>

            <p>If a property is being modified, which can be determined by using the
                <code>svnlook proplist</code> command for the transaction being committed,
                the <em>hook:propchange-access</em> property is also searched on the HEAD
                revision on the files and directories changing.  If the property is not found,
                each parent directory back to the repository root is searched until a match
                is found.  If a matching property is found, the user's permission to modify
                the property is verified and the search is stopped.  If no match is found,
                permission is denied.</p>

            <p>Note that whilst the search for <em>hook:commit-access</em> and 
                <em>hook:propchange-access</em> should both start on and be performed for each
                file or directory being modified (before working their way up the repository path),
                they are independant and should be treated separately.  i.e.  A match on
                <em>hook:commit-access</em> does not stop the search for
                <em>hook:propchange-access</em> properties, and vice versa.<p>
        </dd>

        <dt><dfn>hook: </dfn><span class="term">start-commit</span></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>This hook script searches HEAD revision for the <em>hook:commit-access</em>
                property on the repository root, and if found, verify user is permitted
                to commit.  This enables basic repository access control for each user.</p>
