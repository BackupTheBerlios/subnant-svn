    <h3>Using Subversion properties to email revision details</h3>

    <p>Using <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch07s02.html">properties</a>
    in partnership with the
    <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch05s02.html#svn-ch-5-sect-2.1">post-commit hook</a>
    and <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch05s03.html#svn-ch-5-sect-3.1.1">svnlook</a>,
    we can provide a flexible, granular, visible and version controlled mechanism for emailing
    revision details upon successful commit.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>property: </dfn><span class="term">hook:commit-email</span></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>This property contains a line delimited list of email addresses.  It is used by the
                <em>post-commit</em> hook to determine to whom email should be sent.</p>

            <p><em>hook:commit-email</em> can exist on the directory or parent directories
                of files or directories you wish to monitor.</p>

            <p>Optionally, each email address can be suffixed with an equals sign followed by a
                comma delimited list of svnlook subcommands to be executed, with the results concatenated
                together to form the email content.  When no equals sign is found,
                <code>svnlook diff</code> is executed.</p>

            <p>Accepted svnlook subcommands are:<br />
                <code>author, changed, date, diff, dirs-changed, history, info, log, tree</code></p>

            <p>e.g.: To send an email to “patches@example.com” displaying the differences between
                the current and previous revision (what has changed), and to email “details@example.com”
                displaying who, when and why something was changed in any part of the repository, 
                <em>hook:commit-email</em> is set to the following values on the repository root:</p>>

            <p><samp>patches@example.com<br />
                    details@example.com=author,date,log,changed</samp></p>
        </dd>

        <dt><dfn>hook: </dfn><span class="term">post-commit</span></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>This hook script should call a program which searches the HEAD revision for
                <em>hook:commit-email</em> properties on or above the directories changed.
                The <code>svnlook dirs-changed</code> command can be used in conjunction
                with the revision number passed to post-commit to retrieve list of modified directories.</p>

            <p>If matching properties are found, the hook script will:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Get property values, parsing each email address and subcommand</li>
                <li>Group email addresses by matching svnlook subcommands</li>
                <li>Execute appropriate <code>svnlook <var>subcommand</var></code></li>
                <li>Send email(s) containing svnlook results to each group of matching addresses</li>
            </ol>
        </dd>
    </dl>
